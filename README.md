## What is URL Shortening?

URL shortening transforms long, unwieldy URLs into short, manageable links while maintaining full functionality.

**Example:**
- Long URL: `https://www.example.com/very/long/path?id=12345`
- Short URL: `http://short.ly/abc123`
- User visits short URL and is automatically redirected to long URL

---

## Key Features

- **Create Short Links** - Convert any URL to a 7-character code
- **Instant Redirection** - HTTP 301 redirects for optimal browser caching
- **Time-based Expiration** - Set TTL (time-to-live) for links
- **Click-based Expiration** - Limit number of uses per link
- **Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse (120 req/min default)
- **Analytics** - Track click counts and view top links
- **HEAD Requests** - Check URLs without consuming click counts
- **High Availability** - Redis-backed persistence with optional replication

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create Short Links

**What:** Convert long URLs into short codes

**How:** 
- Accept long URL as input
- Generate unique 7-character code (base62 encoding)
- Store mapping in Redis
- Return short URL to user

**Example:**
```
Input:  "https://www.google.com"
Output: "http://localhost:8080/Vy6UJ4i"
```

### Requirement 2: Resolve & Redirect (HTTP 301)

**What:** Redirect users from short URL to original URL

**How:**
- Lookup short code in Redis
- Return HTTP 301 redirect
- Increment analytics counter (for GET requests)
- Support HEAD requests (check without counting)

**Flow:**
```
User visits: http://localhost:8080/Vy6UJ4i
System finds: https://www.google.com
Browser redirects user to original URL
```

### Requirement 3: Rate Limiting

**What:** Prevent abuse and overload

**How:**
- Track requests per IP address
- Default: 120 requests per minute per IP
- Sliding window algorithm
- Return HTTP 429 when limit exceeded

**Example:**
```
IP makes request #1-120:   Allowed
IP makes request #121:     Blocked (429 Too Many Requests)
After 60 seconds:          Counter resets
```

### Requirement 4: Top Links Analytics

**What:** Show most popular URLs

**How:**
- Track click count per short code
- Maintain sorted set in Redis (O(log N) updates)
- Provide API to query top N links
- Real-time updates

**Example Output:**
```json
[
  {"code": "abc123", "clicks": 1523, "long_url": "https://example.com"},
  {"code": "xyz789", "clicks": 892, "long_url": "https://another.com"},
  {"code": "def456", "clicks": 654, "long_url": "https://third.com"}
]
```

### Requirement 5: Link Expiration

**What:** Automatic link expiration based on time or clicks

**How:**

**Time-based (TTL):**
- Set expiration in seconds (e.g., 3600 = 1 hour)
- Redis handles automatic deletion
- Returns 404 after expiration

**Click-based (max_clicks):**
- Set maximum click count
- Atomic decrement on each access
- Returns 410 when limit reached

**Combined:**
- Both limits can be set
- Link expires when either limit hits

**Example:**
```json
{
  "long_url": "https://example.com",
  "ttl_sec": 3600,
  "max_clicks": 100
}
```

## System Architectures

### Architecture 1: Microservices (HTTP/REST)

**Concept:** Independent, loosely-coupled services communicating via HTTP

**Structure:**
```
API Gateway (Port 8080)
   - Routes requests to services
   - Aggregates responses
   - Single entry point

Redirect Service (Port 8001)
   - Creates short URLs
   - Resolves codes to long URLs
   - Manages expiration

Analytics Service (Port 8002)
   - Tracks click counts
   - Provides top links
   - Real-time statistics

Rate Limit Service (Port 8003)
   - Checks request limits
   - Enforces rate policies
   - Sliding window counters

Redis (Port 6379)
   - Shared data store
   - Persistence layer
```

**Communication:** HTTP/REST with JSON  
**Deployment:** Docker Compose (5 containers)

### Architecture 2: Layered (gRPC)

**Concept:** Vertical stack with strict layer separation and gRPC communication

**Structure:**
```
API Gateway Layer (Port 8081)
   - HTTP to gRPC translation
   - Client-facing interface
   - Request validation

Business Logic Layer (Port 8082)
   - URL validation
   - Code generation
   - Rate limit checks
   - Expiration logic

Data Service Layer (Port 8083)
   - Database operations
   - Redis communication
   - Data persistence

Redis Master (Port 6379)
   - Primary storage

Redis Replica (Port 6380)
   - Backup storage (optional)
```

**Communication:** gRPC with Protocol Buffers  
**Deployment:** Docker Compose (5 containers)
